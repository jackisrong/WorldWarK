^GAMEPLAY
*Play me like one of your Russian comrades
$Goal
%Kill them before they kill you.
%We cannot allow the capitalist
%scum to reach us.
$Levels
%This game is continuous. It gets
%harder and harder until you die,
%much like the sad, terrible lives
%of the capitalists.
$Boss
%There is a boss after each stage.
%You must beat the boss to continue.
%Think of the boss like Soviet Russia,
